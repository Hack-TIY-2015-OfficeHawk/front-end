## Welcome to My Project

Office Hawk was developed by a team of students at The Iron Yard, in Atlanta.  The three groups consisted of students from the Back End Engineering class (Rails), Front End Engineering class (Javascript, AngularJS) and the Mobile iOS Apps class.  

The origin of this app was a Hackathon event where team members were given a website proposal as provided by CodeSmith company personnel.  After a discussion with CodeSmith, the team huddled and began to work through the planning process using SCRUM, Trello, white boards and Slack. 

The proposal was to build a web app that allowed a company manager to track employees using beacon data based on employee cell phone location, while at work.  Employees were required to initially register their name and email address and subsequent to the initial registration, were required to login and logout at the beginning and end of their work day.  From the database provided by the Back End Engineering students and the beacon data provided by the Mobile iOS students, the Front End Engineering students created a system of modular Javascript and HTML components.  From these modular components, multiple web page views were constructed which depicted real/live-time employee identification and location data which could be viewed in a number of unique and easy to read tables and graphs. 

The Office Hawk web app may be viewed on the web at:  http://smooth-swim.surge.sh
